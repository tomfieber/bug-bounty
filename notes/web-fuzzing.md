# Web Fuzzing

## What is Web Fuzzing?

`Web fuzzing` is a technique used to discover vulnerabilities, hidden resources, and security issues in web applications by automatically injecting a large set of input data into the application and analyzing its response. The goal is to identify unexpected behaviors or errors that could indicate potential security weaknesses or misconfigurations.

Fuzzing is commonly employed in security testing to find:

- Hidden directories and files
- Insecure APIs and endpoints
- [SQL injection](sql-injection/sql-injection.md) points
- [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](xss.md) vulnerabilities
- [Command injection](command-injection.md) flaws

## Comparison: Brute-Forcing vs. Fuzzing

| `Criteria`    | `Brute-Forcing`                                                                          | `Fuzzing`                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Definition`  | Systematically trying all possible combinations of input data to guess a specific value. | Injecting unexpected or random data into an application to find vulnerabilities and hidden resources. |
| `Purpose`     | Crack passwords, keys, or other access credentials.                                      | Discover application vulnerabilities, hidden files, directories, and input validation issues.         |
| `Methodology` | Exhaustive search over all possible input combinations.                                  | Dynamic input injection to provoke unexpected application responses.                                  |

## Web APIs: REST, SOAP, and GraphQL

### What is a Web API?

A `Web API` (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. APIs allow different applications to communicate with each other over the internet, enabling the integration of various services and data exchange.

Web APIs can be categorized into three main types:

1. `REST (Representational State Transfer)`
2. `SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)`
3. `GraphQL`

Each type has its own unique characteristics, advantages, and use cases.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)

`REST` is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods to access and manipulate resources on a server. It is known for its simplicity, scalability, and statelessness.

| `Feature`         | `Description`                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Protocol`        | Uses HTTP/HTTPS.                                                                |
| `Data Format`     | Typically JSON, but can also use XML, HTML, or plain text.                      |
| `Stateless`       | Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed. |
| `CRUD Operations` | Uses HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.                                      |
| `Scalability`     | Highly scalable due to its stateless nature.                                    |
| `Caching`         | Supports caching mechanisms to improve performance.                             |
| `URL Structure`   | Uses endpoints that represent resources, e.g., `/api/users/{id}`.               |
| `Advantages`      | Simplicity, flexibility, scalability.                                           |
| `Disadvantages`   | Can lead to over-fetching or under-fetching data.                               |

| `Test All HTTP Methods`          | Ensure all CRUD operations are tested, as vulnerabilities might exist in any of them.   |
| `Validate Input Fields`          | Fuzz input fields with unexpected data types and formats to uncover validation issues.  |
| `Examine Error Messages`         | Analyze error messages for information disclosure or unintended behavior.               |
| `Test Authentication Mechanisms` | Check for improper authentication and authorization controls.                           |
| `Explore API Rate Limits`        | Test rate limits and throttling controls to ensure the API handles requests properly.   |
| `Use Comprehensive Payloads`     | Leverage a variety of payloads (SQLi, XSS) to test for potential security flaws.        |
| `Check Resource Representation`  | Test different resource representations (JSON, XML) for consistency and security flaws. |

### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

`SOAP` is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services. It uses XML as its message format and can operate over various protocols like HTTP, SMTP, or TCP.

| `Feature`            | `Description`                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Protocol`           | Protocol-independent but often used with HTTP/HTTPS.                  |
| `Data Format`        | Exclusively XML.                                                      |
| `Stateful/Stateless` | Can be either stateful or stateless.                                  |
| `WS-Security`        | Built-in security features for message integrity and confidentiality. |
| `Error Handling`     | Uses specific error codes and messages.                               |
| `Complexity`         | More complex due to extensive standards and specifications.           |
| `Extensibility`      | Highly extensible via WS-\* standards.                                |
| `Advantages`         | Strong security, reliability, and extensibility.                      |
| `Disadvantages`      | More complex and less flexible compared to REST.                      |

### GraphQL

`GraphQL` is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request specific data and define the structure of the response.

| `Feature`            | `Description`                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Protocol`           | Uses HTTP/HTTPS, typically over POST requests.                                           |
| `Data Format`        | JSON-based queries and responses.                                                        |
| `Stateful/Stateless` | Stateless architecture.                                                                  |
| `Query Flexibility`  | Clients can request exactly what they need, minimizing over-fetching and under-fetching. |
| `Single Endpoint`    | Typically uses a single endpoint for all operations.                                     |
| `Introspection`      | Allows clients to query the API schema for available operations and data types.          |
| `Advantages`         | Efficiency, flexibility, and powerful developer tooling.                                 |
| `Disadvantages`      | Potential for complex queries leading to performance issues if not properly managed.     |

`GraphQL Fuzzing Tips:`

| `Tip`                                 | `Explanation`                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Test Query Depth and Complexity`     | Evaluate the server's handling of deeply nested or complex queries to avoid performance bottlenecks. |
| `Validate Input Types and Arguments`  | Fuzz input arguments with unexpected values and data types to uncover validation flaws.              |
| `Examine Query Aliasing and Batching` | Test the server's response to aliased queries and batching for potential information leakage.        |
| `Check for Introspection Misuse`      | Ensure introspection is not exposing sensitive information or internal schema details.               |
| `Assess Authorization Controls`       | Verify that access controls are properly enforced for different queries and operations.              |
| `Evaluate Rate Limiting`              | Test rate limits to ensure the API can handle excessive or malicious requests appropriately.         |
| `Fuzz Mutations`                      | Mutations can alter data; test for security issues and improper input validation.                    |
