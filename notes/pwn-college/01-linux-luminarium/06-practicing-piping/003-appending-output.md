Use `>>` to append output to an existing file. 

To practice, run `/challenge/run` with an append-mode redirect of the output to the file `/home/hacker/the-flag`. The practice will write the first half of the flag to the file, and the second half to `stdout` if `stdout` is redirected to the file. If you properly redirect in append-mode, the second half will be appended to the first, but if you redirect in _truncation_ mode (`>`), the second half will _overwrite_ the first and you won't get the flag!

```bash
/challenge/run >> the-flag
```
